Throughout the nineteenth century and into the twentieth century, newspapers and the Bible were frequently intertwined. Newspapers printed sermons and Sunday school lessons, aired political commentary that cited the Bible on every side of issues such as slavery, women's suffrage, and wealth and capitalism, told jokes that featured Bible verses as the punchline, and sometimes even republished lengthy portions of the Scriptures.

"America's Public Bible: Biblical Quotations in U.S. Newspapers" uncovers the presence of biblical quotations in "Chronicling America." Using the techniques of machine learning, I have identified over 866,000 quotations from the  Bible or verbal allusions to specific biblical verses on those newspaper pages.

After an introduction which explains the general trends in how newspapers used the Bible, there are two main ways with which users can interact with the site. First, users can enter a set of biblical references into an interactive visualization, or choose from a selection of significant references on a range of topics. The trend for how those verses were quoted is then charted. The chart is accompanied by a table where each instance of a quotation is linked back to "Chronicling America," with the text of the quoted verse highlighted. The site thus uncovers two contexts for each verse: the context of the newspaper article in which it was used, and the chronological context of quotations from that verse and the Bible as a whole. The second way that users can interact with the site is through a series of supplementary visualizations and brief essays which explain some aspect of how the Bible was used in American newspapers. The site also includes an explanation of its methods.

The site brings together two strands of scholarship. On the one hand, its methodology is drawn from recent digital humanities projects which are concerned with tracking the reuse of texts. On the other hand, it draws on a deep scholarly literature on the Bible as a cultural text in American life. The Bible offered thousands of texts, each of which could be interpreted in many ways. The contribution that this site makes is to show how thousands of biblical verses were used over nearly a century in some 56 billion words of text, revealing trends that are inaccessible to a single scholar's reading of these documents, yet enabling a close reading of the ways in which specific verses were put to use. By looking at how the verses were actually used, we can see how the Bible was a contested yet common text.
