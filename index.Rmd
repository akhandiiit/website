 For most of its issues in 1902, the *Ellensburg Dawn* featured a quotation from Benjamin Franklin prominently on its front page. "A Bible and a newspaper in every house," the quotation proclaimed, "are the principal support of virtue, morality, and civil liberty."^[*Ellensburg Dawn* (Ellensburg, Wash.), [18 Jan. 1902](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn88085012/1902-01-18/ed-1/seq-1/). Also quoted in the *Liberty Advocate* (Liberty, Miss.), [18 Oct. 1845](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83016942/1845-10-18/ed-1/seq-1/>http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83016942/1845-10-18/ed-1/seq-1/#date1=1836&index=0&rows=20&words=Bible+Franklin+newspaper&searchType=basic&sequence=0&state=&date2=1922&proxtext=bible+newspaper+franklin&y=0&x=0&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=1).] Though the quotation from Franklin was doubtless spurious, the pairing of newspapers with the Bible was common. Throughout the nineteenth century and into the twentieth century, newspapers in the United States---even those newspaper which were not published by a religious denomination or organization---had frequent recourse to the Bible. Newspapers printed sermons and Sunday school lessons, and ministers offered lessons through newspaper Bible clubs.^[*Perrysburg Journal* (Perrysburg, Ohio), [18 Sept. 1919](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn87076843/1919-09-18/ed-1/seq-3/); *Amador Ledger* (Jackson, Amador County, Calif.), [19 Feb. 1909](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn93052980/1909-02-19/ed-1/seq-3/).] They featured jokes whose punchlines required biblical literacy. They printed political commentary that cited the Bible.  They made money off of [advertisements](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045433/1918-02-10/ed-1/seq-18/) for Bibles of every kind. Some newspapers even sold Bibles as a way of raising revenue, as when the *[Brattleboro Daily Reformer](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86071593/1916-11-15/ed-1/seq-6/)* and other papers sold an *Illimunated Holy Bible*. But most of all, newspapers quoted the Bible.
